====First
Reading the help and running the applicion will make this document make more sense.

====DB Structure and Application Structure

Each document type, Stuff, Photos, PhotoShows has some unique aspects but they follow
a similar pattern which is reflected in the User Interface ( GUI ) and the database structure

Lets take the stuff type of document as a "typical" case.  The stuff document is rendered in
code by: StuffSubWindow which has the pretty much standard set of tabs
( criteria list detail text Photo History )

The database has a structure to match the GUI  For stuff the tables of interest are:

    stuff
        columns for an id and all of the data that maps one to one with an item
        of stuff except the text

    stuff_text
        columns for an id and the text for a single item.  stuff.id and stuff_text.id
        are equal for the same item

    so far all tables have a primary integer key named id, and the code depends on this

    the events for stuff are in a one to many relationship with the stuff table,
    so they have their own primary key, id and a foreign key to stuff, stuff_id



==== Standards

see Photo win and tab
    table primary key always id
    self.id_field.text()

    more std fields
    many  have add_ts and edit_ts  -- is this a problem for text tables?

    use standard names in all tabs and move as much as possible to ancestors

    model for a tab is always tab_model or model_tab   self. see photo



==== Tech

main    - > stuff_db_qt  --> stuff_db_main_window --> document_maker

sub_windows are documents are QMdiSubWindow

inherit   stuff_dt_tabbed_subwineos   -->  stuff_sub_window

main window -> stuff_db_main_window

stuff-sub_window.py
QMdiSubWindow  -->


==== Adding Documents

* create new tables           db_create.py     old   stuffdb_def.py
* make entry in key_gen       table  under table name
* add to document maker    mdi_management ...
* add to menu              stuffdb_main_window
* copy template
        class Stuff   --> class Photo
        no this caused problems perhaps do manually  or make case sens stuff         --> photo

        field names in:
            window      function

* add to menu in ...  StuffDbMainWindow
* modify new template
    * change table
    * change list tab

            self.photos_tab.select_by_id( id )
* use the code gen for _build_gui   record_to_history  field_to_record, recodd to field

* detail tab
    ** can use field_to_record and record to field or
    ** can use mapper, for now mapper seems easiet

    build_gui
        code gen for some
        build_gui()
            code gen sql to fields
        build mapper()
            code gen:
            disable field-to_record an record_to_field

==== Importing

    Alway look at the quasi constants/parms

    create dir by copying one of existing of similar type
         primary table
         text
         one to many sub records
    rename files above

    export from pb
        copy to dir
        rename files to keep
        delete rest of files

    edit  code_gen_create_sql    -- may rename .sql file to make create for table
        add create to code_gen_sql_create
        some python reserved words create problems
            type
            class     rename to table_name_type.....
         bind var for id should be a_id




    create new import file as required
        in its own directory


    edit import file to change file name everywhere ... be careful
        .dat file seem to have correct cap for file names --- do no lower
        begin code gen, do in order at bottom of file
            when have create sql FUNCTION       = to_sql_create
            run import plant to create table, check to make rue created

     see /mnt/WIN_D/Russ/0000/python00/python3/_projects/stuffdb/sql/update_old_id_and_related.py

        to try to fix old to new id, not sure is right and may be a .py somewhere else

        gen code for splits
           change id to a_id   type to a_type
           fix MAX_SPLITS

        !! think this comes later
        code gen for insert and bind
            change id to a_id   type to a_type

    -- for photo, not currently using for other tables
    Need to transform the .dat file , delimited to a .csv file
    tab delimited

        do this on ram disk for speed
        when setup delete old csv -- it would be appended
        delete issues unless need
        run the
            misname   do_convert_splits which write out various
            tab delimited files
            some for tuning the code
            the final one
                do_convert_splits( mode    =  "one_file_out" )    out with a z or whateve
                check parms prior to run


    ready to running
        check the parms limit lines to say 10
        may need to copy from ram disk if built there
        run
        look at db, did the table get created
        does the table have data
        look at issues txt file
        run with large  MAX_LINES

................................

---- The selection process

    Selection can go in one of several ways

        .... New records
                we should do a save, then create a new key and default
                all the fields on the form....

        .... From Critera
                We construct a query and then execute code on the CriteriaTab.
                this populates a list on the ListTab.

        .... From the List tab
                When we click on the list tab.....
                -----------
                Document   on_list_clicked( self, index: QModelIndex )  ( promote this ??)
                -->    self.fetch_row_by_id( db_key )  ( delete this )
                -->    self.select_record
                            calls down to
                                    detail
                                    text
                                    picture   using select_record





        .... From the history tab
                When we click on the list  .....
                        history_tab   on_cell_clicked
                        self.parent_window.select_record( a_id )


        .... From the menu/toolbar, prior next for list
                main window
                     self.go_active_sub_window_func,
                                      "next_list_to_detail"     )

                     -->  Document next_list_to_detail(   )

                          perhaps prior next in here as a partial
                          self.set_list_to_detail_ix( new_list_ix )

                          ...... maybe should use prior next .... no this is what prior next uses

                          eventually

                              detail_tab.select_record( id_data ) ===> changed to self.select_record as bug fix

                              but it looks like it should have done this at document
                              level and perhaps thru prior next



        .... From the menu/toolbar, prior next for history
                    "next_history_to_detail"

                        # -----------------------------
                        def next_history_to_detail( self ):

                            --> self.set_history_to_detail_ix( list_ix + 1 )



                            look into on_history clicked everywhere  --- may be ok goes thru cell clicke on history tab
                                not clear if called at all --- still needs investigate


---- Critera tab

    fields to caputre the users desired criteria
    later conveerted to a dict for the select
    which is done by
    criteria_select()



---- List tab


    when a row is clicked on the id of the table is sent to the detail tab ( and parent? ) and
    records are selected   select_record across all tabs and sub tabsl

    clicked on --
        build gui sets up clicked on to go to on_list_clicked ( parent_window  )


    next/prior --



----Detail tab




    select_recod in the parent gets the data which is then
    moved to the fields using either a mapper or field_to_record/record to field


    add    ---
        toolbar --
             "new_record"
                    to document base
            or
              "copy_prior_row"
                        to document
       go_active_sub_window_func

        document base
            new_row
                send new record on to tabs together with the new key


----HistoryTab
    should recieve notice of fetch, updat ore delete
    right now code is in StuffDbTab select_record  where it calls
        something like record to history table this should be only select location
        save and delete should be added, probably with a different function for
        the delete

    still issuse of the column names and headers in the history display



----SubTab Many to Many
----SubTab One to Many
----stuff_events

    one to many with stuf  stuff.id

---- stuff photos

    many to many a lot like albums -- but no update
    comes from the photo_subject file
    this is not an updatable tab, just a view
    photos are added from the picturedocument
    relational widget should work never send insert update....

----key_gen
        define table
        update table


--database structure
    see data_dict.py for basic def
        also code_gen.py
       .....
        update_key_gen.py


---- What Triggers a Save/Update

    In general we do not want the user to have to concously ask the
    system to save data, not saving is the exception.
    There are also technical reasons for saving, for example to
    do a reselect to refresh the gui.

    All saves should be preceeded by a verify cycle, which
    will throw an exception ( later caucht ) if validation fails



    Here I will try to summarize the events that trigger saves.

        Changing tabs
            when we shift between tabs the detail and text data plus
            any sub tabs are saved.





         Selecting a new record

                 DocumentBase.on_list_clicked
                search DocumentBase for self.validate()
                    self.update_db()


         Adding a record



==== Crud cycle


action          = QAction(  "Add", self )
connect_to      = functools.partial(  self.go_active_sub_window_func,
                                      "new_record"     )
action.triggered.connect( connect_to )
toolbar.addAction(action)

action          = QAction(  "Add/Copy", self )
connect_to      = functools.partial(  self.go_active_sub_window_func,
                                      "copy_prior_row"     )
action.triggered.connect( connect_to )
toolbar.addAction( action )

action          = QAction(  "Save", self )
connect_to      = functools.partial(  self.go_active_sub_window_func,
                                      "update_db"     )



        select



        update/save

            -- starts in menu
                update_db    in document window
                    should call update_db in all the sub-documents
                    but first we call validate

                validate loops thru the fields calling validate
                validate returns is_bad truthy if validate is bad
                        still not sure how to manage this
                              will need a message and a location
                              may want to activate tab ( no should try to save on tab change )
                              position to field
                                what are return args, how passed back ( consider custom excpetion )


                if validate is ok then

                update_db at document level loops thru sub_documents
                        calls

                        this update needs to branch based on record status

                        for self.update_record_fetched()
                             this can use mapper or field_to_record]
                                  think now useing field_to_record for detail tabs
                                          get_data_for_record  in field widget

                        now we have all the data so about time to submit






# ---- photo_subject
# ------------ok ----------------
SELECT

             photo.id,
             photo.name,
             photo.photo_fn


    from     photo

    JOIN   photo_subject
    ON     photo_subject.photo_id = photo.id

    WHERE  photo_subject.table_joined = "stuff"
           and photo_subject.table_id = 9;


# ---- photo_subject 2
# ------------ ok ----------------
SELECT

             photo.id,
             photo.name,
             photo.photo_fn


    from     photo_subject

    JOIN   photo
    ON     photo_subject.photo_id = photo.id

    WHERE  photo_subject.table_joined = "stuff"
           and photo_subject.table_id = 9;


====Environment/Tools

db


id   key


sql


click or clicked   .... be consistent



====ramdisk

in bulldog linux cheatsheet and parameters
     sudo mkdir /tmp/ramdisk #

    >> sudo chmod 777 /tmp/ramdisk # all users can use

    >> sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=1024m myramdisk /tmp/ramdisk #

    >> sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=5G myramdisk /tmp/ramdisk # nG for the RAM disk,

    >> mount | tail -n 1 # to see if it is mounted


====Import DB from scratch

use ramdisk so much faster

go to import photo

may want to check sql gen stuff, still in flux

then

drop table
create table
import table

may have to move files to ramdisk

seemed to go ok oct 14 --- but still some import adj to make

think I skipped som steps to get the tabldelimited version
and test versions see some commented out stuff higher in import_photo
think now enough for some gui testing
