Some of the deviations from other documents:

    the detail and text are on the same tab
    details do not have sub tabs
    no pictures -- so far we may want to add 
         but then more like stuff
         
        
         
A feature  that has its home on this tab, but has been extended
to other text tabs is that the text may contain "executable text"
"executable text" is specially marked text in the body of the
edit contrrl that can be executed in one of several ways.

        as python code
        as search intstustions within the application
        as a link to a url
        as a command to open a file
        
        code to be executed is marked by a line beginning with ">>"
        and may extend for several addtional lines.
        
        right after the ">>" is a "tab" for the type of execution
        desired:  tabs are
        
                    py for python
                    url to open a url
                    search_xxx for a search ( in the stuff system )
                    open to open a file ( using the system defaults )
                    txt to opena a file with a text ecitor
                    idle to open some text in the idle ide 
                    
                     

        !! = comming  soon maybe
        text may be used to search for other documents in other widows
        ( or the current window )
        
        python code may be run -- useful for example code
        
        --- we may add the ablity to run other types of code, say shell scripts
        
        !! we can open a url in our web browser
