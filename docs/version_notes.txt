            ** already had a key_gen entry
            !! help table missing timstamp fields, need to add and redo data
            ** remove stuff sub tabs
            ** stuff had some dead code already out of help but still in stuff
            ** looks like no change to document_maker because opens in same way as channel versigon

            4:50 first trial
            4:55 basically runs, with mucho bugs -- history not right -- go see if stuff history is ok

        *! review stuff document to new standards
                ** basics working other stuff still needs checking
                !! select from criteria not working
        !! also for photo show


--- ver17   ----- move on do a big delete
    why:
        most of crud works on photo --- less some important details
        and much promoted, backup and delete stuff


        **  saved fetched seems good, factoring out seems good
        *!  get saved new..... working --- ok but timestamp issues
        *!  promote save new to ancestor
        !!  next prior for list seems to not work on text


--- ver16
    why:
        lots of progress on photo ( and a bit on photo show )
        promote some to ancestors, clean up and
        continue to get save and new .... working on photo

        ^^ add -> save works on photo_text but not photo so convert photo to crud
        !! a key or id or a_id or a mix it is the key gen key might be value id column name
        !! add seems to add but will not save....
        !! add should on save add to history
        !! add in text if missing -- working on in photo_sub_window
        !! add labels to photo_sub window  detail
        get a criteria select working for $like$  may be some code around
        fill in from below:
        *! add a tab for one photo at a time -- add the prior next buttons to it
        *! some update code in place, second model one that updates
        *! get basics of photo show working
            !! select from criteria  just for %like%
            *! single photo tab

--- ver14
    why:
        big struggle getting photos read only working, prior code thouth good
        was not AI cold not fix until along cam black_box.
        not finished the conversion but too much dead and dying code so
