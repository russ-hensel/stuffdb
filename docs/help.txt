this is help for stuff_db_qt


Watch out overlaps with general document help  ---- move merge .... 



This is an application and framework for tracking of stuff where stuff can be any kind of stuff:

	implemented or working on
		help topics,
			-- basically text around a topic

		stuff
			-- basically physical think to be kept track of

		photos
			-- typically images in files with some sort of graphic content

		plants
			-- things that grow

		some interactions between the above are also managed:
			-- ex: items of stuff may have one or more photos


Gui and ....

	Each category ( stuff, photo ... ) has its own window(s) using a multi document interface.
    From one of these windows you can select any of the "document" of the type the
    window is designed to manage.

	Each window has its own set of tabs, typically (but with useful variations):

		-- criteria:
				criteria for selection, perhaps for a photo in the photo document

		-- list
				a list of items, say photos, that meet the criteria from the tab above

		-- detail
				detail on a particular item, selected from the list tab, the history tab, or
                by creating a new item.

                Some detail tab may have their own sub-tabs such as:
                    events about the item
                    photos or other graphics about the item.


		-- text
  				text, basically a document about the item.  Usually on its own tab to give it
                pleanty of room.

        -- Photo
                for display of a single photo, typically selected on the Detai Tab

		-- history
				a list of items that have been displayed in the detail tab since
				the document ( window ) was opened.  Click on a history item
                and it will be selected on the detail tab.

Document, features and purpose

    All ( most ) documents
        search by criterr
        list for results search
        history of documents viewed
        long text -- almost all
        photos    -- most, with some variations

    Help
        Mostly text topics as notes for your reference

    Photos
        Photos with names - captions for the photos.
        Photos can be associated with other items in the stystem like People or Stuff

    People
        Contact information....
        Photos for them

    Stuff
        Meant for physical ( and usually dead ) stuff that you are tracking for some reaason.
        Has photos and long text.
        Also events.
        There is also the idea that some stuff is a container for other stuff, so you can "find" or "store"
        stuff

    PhotoShows
        some would call an album

    Plant
        Information on some kind of plant, like a tomato.
