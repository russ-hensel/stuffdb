#---- key word issues


              the sql would be

                I would like the sql for finding
                duplicate rows in a table where the
                table is created with

                CREATE TABLE help_key_word  (
                    id  INTEGER,
                    key_word  TEXT )

        >> find the dups
                SELECT id, key_word, COUNT(*) AS count
                FROM help_key_word
                GROUP BY id, key_word
                HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

         >> delete the dups

            WITH CTE AS (
                SELECT id, key_word, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id, key_word ORDER BY id) AS row_num
                FROM help_key_word
            )
            DELETE FROM help_key_word
            WHERE (id, key_word) IN (
                SELECT id, key_word FROM CTE WHERE row_num > 1
            );

            no error but did it work  --- seems to have worked


------------ detect the dups for one id


        >> find the dups
                SELECT id, key_word, COUNT(*) AS count
                FROM help_key_word
                WHERE id = 1003
                GROUP BY id, key_word
                HAVING COUNT(*) > 1  ;


SELECT id, key_word, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM help_key_word
WHERE id = 1003
GROUP BY id, key_word
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
