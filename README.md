StuffDb  -- A database system about Stuff

A desktop gui system using qt to track all sorts of "stuff"  

This is my first time with qt for sql, it has been an adventure

At this point some stuff works, but still very far from a useful system.

This is a reimplemtation of a system I wrote 20 years ago in powerbulider, it
will take a long time to replicat all of its features, but I will be able
to add new many new features, such as geolocation for maps, and builtin
editor for long text.

Note:
  I still like to keep the code right in the git root, see main.py to 
  start it up ( some code probably missing from repository, but will come in time )
