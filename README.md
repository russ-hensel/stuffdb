StuffDb  -- A database system about Stuff

A desktop gui system using qt to track all sorts of "stuff"  
  stuff includes:
      text notes = help
      physical item, a collection, a set of woodworking tools... = stuff document
      an address book ++   = people document
      information about plants = plant document
      pictures with notes ... linked to other documents = picture document
      albums documents: a collection of pictures
      ......

This is my first time with qt for sql, it has been an adventure

Status:
  At this point some stuff works, but still very far from a useful system.
  The current db is around the help document which works fairly well.

  Will soon have a db for all the documents, mostly empty.

This is a reimplemtation of a system I wrote 20 years ago in powerbulider, it
will take a long time to replicat all of its features, but I will be able
to add new many new features, such as geolocation for maps, and builtin
editor for long text.

Note:
  I still like to keep the code right in the git root, see main.py to 
  start it up ( some code probably missing from repository, but will come in time )


Install:
  There is none, just download all the files and try to run it in
  some sort of development environment.
  
  When it complains about dependencies add them

  I am running in Py12

Requirements  no .txt
  Biggest one is probably pyqt5 -- i install by using anaconda and spyder which
    includes it.

  wat inspector

  will work on this in a bit feel free to send feedback
